# Ansible Overview

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool designed to simplify IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks across servers, network devices, and cloud environments using simple, human-readable YAML files called playbooks.

## Why Use Ansible for Network Automation?

- **Agentless Architecture:**  
  Ansible communicates with network devices over SSH without needing any additional software or agents installed on the devices. This reduces complexity and maintenance.

- **Simplicity:**  
  Playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax that is easy to read and write, making automation accessible even for beginners.

- **Idempotence:**  
  Ansible ensures that running the same playbook multiple times results in the same device state, avoiding unintended changes or errors.

- **Scalability:**  
  Easily manage a few devices or thousands by defining your inventory and playbooks appropriately.

- **Extensive Module Support:**  
  Ansible provides network modules for many vendors including Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Palo Alto, and more.

## Core Concepts

- **Playbooks:**  
  These are YAML files that describe the desired state of devices. Playbooks contain one or more plays, each targeting hosts and defining tasks.

- **Inventory:**  
  A list of devices to manage, organized into groups for easier targeting.

- **Modules:**  
  Pre-built commands that Ansible uses to interact with devices, e.g., `ios_config` for Cisco IOS device configuration.

- **Tasks:**  
  Individual steps in a playbook that run modules to achieve configuration goals.

## How Ansible Works

1. **Connects to Devices:**  
   Uses SSH and existing OS credentials to securely communicate with devices.

2. **Executes Modules:**  
   Sends commands or configurations via modules.

3. **Applies Changes:**  
   Ensures the device matches the intended configuration state.

4. **Reports Status:**  
   Displays which tasks were changed, skipped, or failed.
